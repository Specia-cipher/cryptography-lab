# Cryptography Lab

## Project Overview

This Cryptography Lab is a hands-on project focused on developing practical cryptographic tools in Python. The lab emphasizes core cryptographic concepts such as hashing and asymmetric encryption, implemented as user-friendly command-line utilities. It serves both as a learning resource and a technical portfolio demonstrating solid cryptography skills.

## Project Goals

- Develop practical cryptographic tools supporting multiple algorithms and flexible usage.  
- Implement secure cryptographic primitives including:  
  - Hashing with multiple algorithms and output formats  
  - Asymmetric encryption (RSA) with key generation, encryption, and decryption  
- Maintain clear, concise documentation explaining tool usage and cryptographic concepts.  
- Use Git and GitHub for version control, ensuring reproducibility and collaboration readiness.  
- Build a modular, extensible codebase for future cryptographic functions (digital signatures, symmetric encryption, key exchange, etc.).  
- Explore cryptography development in diverse environments, including Termux on Android.  
- Create a portfolio-quality project showcasing technical skills and understanding of cryptography.

## Current Features

- **Hashing Tool:** Supports multiple hashing algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-1, MD5, SHA-3, BLAKE2, etc.) with options to list available algorithms.  
- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Basic RSA implementation for key generation, encryption, and decryption (coming soon to the repo).  

## Usage

### Hashing Tool

- Hash a message (default SHA-256):

##

python hashing_tool.py "Your message here"

##


- Hash with a specific algorithm:

##


python hashing_tool.py "Your message here" -a sha1

##


- List all supported hash algorithms:


##

python hashing_tool.py --list

##


### Asymmetric Encryption

*(To be added with usage examples once implemented)*

## Roadmap

- Expand asymmetric encryption features with key management and file encryption.  
- Add digital signatures and verification tools.  
- Implement symmetric encryption utilities (AES, ChaCha20).  
- Enhance hashing tool with file hashing and salting options.  
- Improve documentation with tutorials and cryptographic background.

## Development Environment

- Developed using Python 3.x in Termux on Android and Linux environments.  
- Version controlled with Git and hosted on GitHub for collaboration and tracking.
